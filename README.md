# 📝 Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on building a **Sentiment Analysis model** to classify text (e.g., reviews or tweets) into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiment. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning algorithms** to predict emotions from textual data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classify text as **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiment.
- Preprocess data with techniques like **tokenization** and **stopword removal**.
- Use models like **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or **LSTM**.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics like **accuracy and precision**.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
1. Prepare the dataset (place it in the `data/` folder).
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```
4. Test the model with sample inputs using the provided notebook or script.

## 📊 Dataset
We used the **IMDB Reviews Dataset** (or any dataset of your choice) for training. Ensure the dataset has labeled text data for sentiment classification.

---

## 🔍 Evaluation
- **Accuracy:** XX%
- **Precision:** XX%
- **Recall:** XX%

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Integrate **real-time sentiment analysis** using Twitter API.
- Experiment with **deep learning models** like LSTM or BERT.
- Deploy the model using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
